# Yottasynth

Yottasynth is an under-development digital synthesizer. It is an open hardware
project built around an ARM microcontroller, with custom hardware, 3D-printed
parts, and ongoing firmware development.

## Status

This is a work-in-progress journey to build a full synth.

## Hardware + 3D

- Board design files: `etc/board/` (open with KiCad)
- Enclosure STL files: `etc/enclosure/` (print with your slicer app)
- Touch screen interface and ARM-based digital synth core
